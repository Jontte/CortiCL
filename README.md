Corticl is a C++/OpenCL implementation of the HTM Cortical Learning Algorithm by Numenta.

Numenta owns the Intellectual Property of the HTM algorithm. Please refer to Numenta website (http://numenta.org/) for more information.

Also note that I am not affiliated with the company, and that this library is the result of programming in my free time.
